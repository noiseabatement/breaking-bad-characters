# breaking-bad-characters

this project uses fetch to get characaters. there is a search bar that matches with names. With checkbox you can filter the characters who appeared at Better Call Saul.
But when you checked the checkbox searchbar does not working because checkbox and search bar have two different function. This time styling was okey for me. As always there is small 
thing that i want to correct. When you start typing search bar moves a little bit to right.I didn't get why.
Most important thing that i want to add but failed: 
  clicked state of element should show some information about character like status or nickname etc..
  I succeeded it but after that i failed to bring back the image and name.
  Also i want to make this change with coin-flip animation.
